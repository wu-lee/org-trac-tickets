So far this is merely a cobbled-together means of turning org-mode
entries into Trac tickets.

Having loaded the library, position the point over an org-mode entry,
and execute org-trac-create-ticket-from-entry, and you should after a
pause find that your entry has a ticket ID inserted, and the Trac
project has a ticket inserted with the same ID.
